    Explain the generator

Example:
    rails generate admin_resource Thing name description --actions show index update new edit create

        app/controllers/admin/things_controller.rb
        app/views/admin/things/_form.html.slim
        app/views/admin/things/edit.html.slim
        app/views/admin/things/index.html.slim
        app/views/admin/things/new.html.slim
        app/views/admin/things/show.html.slim
